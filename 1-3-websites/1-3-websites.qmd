# Anatomy of a Quarto project {background-color="#4C326A"}
 
## Quarto projects

-   Quarto projects have a `_quarto.yml` file

-   The `type` field in this file indicates the type of project:

    -   `default`: Collection of documents

    -   `website`: Websites (and blogs)

    -   `books`: Books ðŸ˜ƒ

## Quarto websites

-   Websites are essentially `format: html` + a Quarto Project

-   But a website is different than `format: html` in that it has multiple pages

-   Websites are our first exploration into Quarto Projects

-   Websites and books are very similar in that they associate multiple pages/resources into a connected resource

## Our turn

::: task
Let's build a website together. We will highlight the following features of Quarto websites:

-   `_quarto.yml`

-   `index.qmd` / landing page 

-   Navigation

:::

## Your turn

::: task
Pick up where we left off and

-   Add your details to the about page (index.qmd) [about page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html).
