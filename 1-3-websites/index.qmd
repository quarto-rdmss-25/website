## Exercises

For exercises in this module we'll use documents that you prepared as part of your pre-work assignments: [Pre-work Assignment 5: About page](../0-2-pre-work/).

We will work through the following steps in class

## Create a website

Write up your About page using the Quarto file format.

1. Open the "Content" page of the Posit Cloud workspace for the course: <https://posit.cloud/spaces/657572/content/all?sort=name_asc>

2. Click on "New Project" button to create a new project

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/01-website-new-project.png")
```

3. Click on "New RStudio Project"

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/02-website-new-project-rstudio.png")
```

4. While the project deploys, rename it from "Untitled Project" to "website" by clicking on the "Untitled Project" text in the top-left corner of the RStudio window. You can also rename it after deployment has concluded.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/03-website-rename.png")
```

5. Delete the `setup.qmd` from the Files in the bottom-right window.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/04-website-delete-setup.png")
```

6. Delete or update the `README.md` file in the Files in the bottom-right window.

7. Create a Blank file using Quarto Document, name it `index.qmd` and save it in the root of the project.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/05-website-new-quarto-doc.png")
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/06-website-name-index.png")
```

8. Open the `index.qmd` file and write up your page with guidance (e.g. copy/paste and replace) from  [Quarto documentation for About Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html) 


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/07-website-copy-about.png")
```

9. Render the `index.qmd` file to see what your website will look like

10. Keep updating the `index.qmd` until you are satisfied with the content and layout (e.g. try a different template, add your profile photo to the project folder, etc.)
